# Exercise 3: Socio-spatial differentiation & social segregation

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
Today’s theme is socio-spatial differentiation & social segregation and we’re going to be looking at the
Helsinki metropolitan area’s population dynamics.  One of the key components of the city is as Shakespeare so eloquently put in Coriolanus “What is the city, but the people?”

Socio-economic features of the inhabitants of the city vary across geographical space and across time.
Today we are using the Statistics Finland’s Grid Database 2016 about the social structure in 250x250m
grid cells. Our task today is to study socio-spatial differentiation and pinpoint low-education and low-income
grid cells. This could also be an interesting starting point for the analysis if we study segregation
in the region.

To do this, the data needs some clean-up, some fields need to be calculated and the lowest quartiles for
different variables (income, education) have to be found. You will be learning to use the conditional statement
functionality. The results are once again to be visualized on a map and to be
analyzed in the report.
