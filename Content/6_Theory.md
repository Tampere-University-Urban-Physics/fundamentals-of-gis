### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Theory 6: Thiessen polygons and heatmapping (kernel density estimation)

## Heatmap analysis
Spatial phenomena tend to vary in intensity across a geographical area. When the occurrence of a certain phenomenon is significantly higher in one area than in the surrounding area, you could describe it as a “hotspot” for that phenomenon. For instance, cities are hotspots of buildings and human activity, forests are hotspots of trees etc. There are many ways to locate these hotspots: interpolation, cluster analysis, and heatmap analysis, to name a few. Today we’re taking a look at heatmaps and heatmap analysis. 

As the name would suggest, heatmaps describe the “heat,” or intensity, of the phenomenon in question. Heatmaps are generated with point feature data and form a raster layer. In its most rudimentary form, the pixel values of a heatmap depict proximity to other point features within a certain, user-specified, radius. A slightly more advanced form of heatmaps can be given a weight (from the point features’ attribute table) that will influence the pixel values.

For instance, two heatmaps are created out of the same point feature layer (bus stops). One heatmap wasn’t given a weight, so it only looks for other bus stops within a certain radius, e.g. 500 meters. The other was given a weight, e.g. daily passenger amount, from the attribute table of the bus stops layer. To generate this other heatmap, the GIS software not only looks for bus stops within a radius of 500 meters of each other, but also gives the bus stops with higher passenger amounts a higher weight. Thus, the bus stops with a high daily passenger amount will be “favored” in the resulting heatmap raster layer.

One step more advanced form of heatmap will also include modification of the kernel shape. Kernel is the statistical function used to give proximity and weight scores to the point features within the radius. Heatmaps are also known as kernel density analysis.

### What happens in Kernel Density Analysis?

To understand the basic idea of Kernel Density Analysis that we use to create a heatmap, you can watch this 9 minutes long video (Point Pattern Analysis Part 5: Kernel Density Estimation): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBZVTjmhl74

When applying the kernel method, QGIS draws a circular neighborhood around each sample point (not each cell) and then applies a math function that goes from 1 at the location of the point to 0 at the neighborhood boundary. Think of a kernel as a smoothly curved surface that is fitted over each point.

When a kernel function is applied to each data point, the effect is like that of an elevation surface, except that the density value for each cell is calculated by adding the values of all the kernel surfaces where they overlay the cell center.

The kernel function generally creates a smoother-looking surface than one created with the simple method[^1].

Otherwise, don't worry about it for now and move on! 

## Thiessen polygons/Voronoi diagram

Thiessen polygons, also known as Voronoi polygons or Voronoi diagrams, are a method used to divide a space into regions based on proximity to a set of input points or data. Each polygon represents the area that is closest to a specific point in the dataset.

Here's how Thiessen polygons work:

1.  Input points: The first step is to have a set of input points. These points can represent any geographic feature, such as cities, weather stations, or sampling locations.
    
2.  Nearest neighbor determination: For each input point, the nearest neighboring points are identified. This is typically done using a distance-based algorithm, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.
    
3.  Construction of polygons: Once the nearest neighbors are determined, Thiessen polygons are constructed. Each polygon is defined by connecting the input point to its neighboring points, forming a boundary that encloses the area closest to that particular input point.
    
4.  Polygon attributes: Each Thiessen polygon is associated with the input point it originated from. This allows for the transfer of attributes or characteristics from the input points to their respective polygons. For example, if the input points represent weather stations, the Thiessen polygons can be used to determine which areas are influenced by each station.

Thiessen polygons have various applications in GIS analysis and spatial modeling. They can be used for proximity analysis, such as determining service areas or catchment areas around facilities. They are also useful for interpolation, as they provide a way to estimate values at unsampled locations based on the values at the input points within each polygon.
