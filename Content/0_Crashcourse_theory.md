### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and QGIS

## Course introduction

### Learning outcomes
After completing the course you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of GIS, including rasters, vector, projections, geoprocessing and analysis
- Apply basic GIS skills to:
	- Map Design
	- Gathering GIS data from various sources
	- Use different types of spatial data
	- Analyse GIS data to address geosptial problems and/or research questions 
- Develop the aiblity to perform new anayses, troubleshoot, and find help from the GIS community to solve your problems

### Structure
The course consists of **9 exercises**, each accompanied by a piece of theory. The first exercise, which goes with this theory, is meant to give you the basic skills in GIS and the software we will be using, QGIS. From there on you will build on these basic skills using the other exercises, covering vairous analyses and methods, and develop a fundamental skillset in GIS and QGIS. 

| Exercise | Topic | Methods |
|--|--|--|
| Crash Course | Introduction | QGIS interface & Vector analysis |
| 1 | Vector analysis introduction | Digitizing, georeferencing, clipping |
| 2 | Socio-spatial differentiation | Raster analysis |
| 3 | Finding the optimal location for a new development | Buffer analysis, overlay analysis |
| 4 | Determining optimal land for cultivation | Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, hillshade, overlay analysis |
| 5 | Understnading disease transmission | Heatmap analysis (Kernel Density), Voronoi diagram, text processing |
| 6 | Air quality analysis | Spatial interpolation
| 7 | Calculating building efficiency | Expressions, creating grids |
| 8 | Wind power NIMBY (Not in my backyard) analysis | Public Paticipation GIS/SoftGIS, Directional Distribution |

### Evalution
To get the credits for this course, the following criteria have to be met:
 - [ ] Submitted original map output(s) for each exercise
 - [ ] Submitted original map reflection for each exercise
 - [ ] Completed the X Moodle exams  

### Getting help
- Step by step process
1. Materials (location, extras, etc)
2. Googling
3. Communal chat
4. Directly to teachers
