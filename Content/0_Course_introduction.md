### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
 
# Course introduction

**Welcome to the *Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)* course!** This is an open course developed by Tampere University meant to get you started with GIS and give you the ability to work with GIS independently. 

This course can be completed independently, or as a student at the Tampere University. Everyone is able to access the course materials and support, with the exception that students have to complete a number of criteria and if they do so, they are eligible for ECTS credits. 

## Learning outcomes
After completing the course you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of GIS, including rasters, vector, projections, geoprocessing and analysis
- Apply basic GIS skills to:
	- Map Design
	- Gathering GIS data from various sources
	- Use different types of spatial data
	- Analyse GIS data to address geosptial problems and/or research questions 
- Develop the aiblity to perform new anayses, troubleshoot, and find help from the GIS community to solve your problems

## Structure
The course consists of **9 exercises**, each accompanied by a piece of theory. It's recommended to go through the theory before attempting the exercise. The first exercise is meant to give you the basic skills in GIS and the software we will be using, QGIS. From there on you will build on these basic skills using the other exercises, covering various analyses and methods, and develop a fundamental skillset in GIS and QGIS. 

| Exercise | Topic | Methods |
|--|--|--|
| [1](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/1_Crashcourse_theory.md) | Crash Course| QGIS interface & Vector analysis |
| [2](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/2_Theory.md) | Vector analysis introduction | Digitizing, georeferencing, clipping |

| [4](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/4_theory.md) | Finding the optimal location for a new development | Buffer analysis, overlay analysis |
| [5](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/5_Theory.md) | Determining optimal land for cultivation | Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, hillshade, overlay analysis |
| [6](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/6_Theory.md) | Understanding disease transmission | Heatmap analysis (Kernel Density), Voronoi diagram, text processing |
| [7](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/7_Theory.md) | Air quality analysis | Spatial interpolation
| [8](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/8_Theory.md) | Calculating building efficiency | Expressions, creating grids |
| [9](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Content/9_Theory.md) | Wind power NIMBY (Not in my backyard) analysis | Public Participation GIS/SoftGIS, Directional Distribution |

## Evaluation
To get the credits for this course, the following criteria have to be met:
 - [ ] Submitted original map output(s) for each exercise
	 - With your name on the output
 - [ ] Submitted original map reflection for each exercise
 - [ ] Completed the Moodle exams  

To ensure that your submissions are original:
- Map output: Your name has to be mentioned on the map output and they will be compared with others
- Map reflection: Anti-plagiarism tool is used

## Troubleshooting
If you ever have a question or run in to an issue along this course, please follow the following troubleshooting process: 

![Troubleshooting process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/0_Course_introduction/GIS_troubleshooting_process.drawio.png)
1. Start by checking if the information in the **course materials** provide a solution, it might have been covered in the previous theory or exercises as well
	- If you come across missing information in the materials, please let us know so we can make sure others don't run into the same issue! 
2. Being a *Professional **Google** Searcher* will get you really far with (Q)GIS. Try searching your question or issue, below you can find some tips on how to improve your google searches
	- [Simple Google Search tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIMTM168BK8)
	- [How to "Google It" like a Senior Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBkvm0-rg0)
	- [Refine web searches](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en)
3. Ask your question in the **chat**, other students or professionals will be able to help you! Use the channel of the exercise you are working on. 
	- [Chat invite link (Microsoft Teams)](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19:HduKwpmM4c7LyKk3vcQFZnV_uIFMB63WvG-e_p6P1wM1@thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=713525aa-e19b-4ba5-9491-cba5bcfc17be&tenantId=fa6944af-cc7c-4cd8-9154-c01132798910)
5.  If at this point you still have not found a resolution, you can ping the **teachers** in the channel with @teachers

Following this process will help you **develop the independent troubleshooting skills** you will need when you use GIS on your own.
