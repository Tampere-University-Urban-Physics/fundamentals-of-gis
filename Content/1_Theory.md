### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Theory 1: Georeferencing & digitizing

When some kind of urban development happens, the data we use in GIS needs to updated. Someone has to go in and updated the changes to the roads, buildings, and others. This would be done by digitizing the changes, as you will be learning in this theory and exercise. 

For this practice we are going to use the Nokia Arena development in Tampere, as you can see belo



## Digitizing
- Digitizing toolbar

## Georeferencing
- More points + more spacing == better?
So, what needs to happen if the data is not up to date anymore?
