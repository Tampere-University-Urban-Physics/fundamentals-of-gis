## Overview & purpose
Urban areas undergo continuous development, and maps need to be updated regularly to account for new construction, demolition, and land use changes for example. In this tutorial, the objective is to ** edit a GIS layer** to show urban development. In this case, we will be looking at the development of the Nokia Arena in the city centre of Tampere, Finland. 

The learning objectives are:
