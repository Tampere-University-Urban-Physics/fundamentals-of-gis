### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 1: Introduction continuation

## Overview & purpose
Urban areas undergo continuous development, and maps need to be updated regularly to account for new construc-tion, demolition, and land use changes for example. In this tutorial, the learning objective is to **understand how to edit a GIS layer** to show urban development. In this case, we will be looking at the development of the Nokia Arena in the city Tampere city centre. There is no research question this week â€“ rather, we are just learning how to edit a map.
