# Theory 4: Digital Elevation Model, Hillshade, and raster overlay analysis

## Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
A digital elevation model (DEM) is a three-dimensional representation of the Earth's surface that is created using elevation data. It is a digital representation of the topography of a particular area, typically displayed as a grid of elevation values.

DEM data is collected using various methods, including remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar, or photogrammetry. These methods involve sending out signals or capturing images from different perspectives to measure the height of the Earth's surface at specific points.

The resulting elevation data is then processed and interpolated to create a continuous representation of the terrain. The grid of elevation values in a DEM is often represented as a raster dataset, where each cell or pixel contains the elevation information for that location.

DEM data has numerous applications in various fields, including geography, geology, environmental science, urban planning, and engineering. It is used for visualizing and analyzing terrain characteristics, mapping landforms, identifying slopes and aspect, hydrological modeling, determining visibility and line of sight, and more. DEMs are essential in creating accurate maps, conducting terrain analysis, and supporting decision-making processes in numerous industries and research domains.
