### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 7:

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

## OBJECTIVES

In this tutorial, we will learn about spatial interpolation using QGIS. We will work with point data from air pollution monitoring stations in Helsinki to estimate air pollution levels in locations where there are no stations available. We will be asking ourselves the following research questions:

- What are the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution in the Helsinki region?
- Do any areas exceed the EU recommended limit?
- What is the concentration in the wealthiest postcode? And the least wealthy?

## DATA USED/NEEDED

## Completion

Work in pairs or individually. Complete the exercise and submit a short report containing at least the following:

1. Maps of the outcome of the exercise

	- Remember: all maps should have a legend, a scale bar and a north arrow

	- Use the tips from the Crash Course to improve your map

2. A short reflection (200-300 words) on this exercise and your map

## EXERCISE PHASES

### Part 1 - Loading data

1. Save and extract the downloaded GIS data in a folder for this project. We have data on the location of air pollution monitoring sites in the Helsinki region.

2. Load the file Air_pollution_monitoring_points.shp into your QGIS project.

3. Examine the attribute table o fthe layer you added, what d
