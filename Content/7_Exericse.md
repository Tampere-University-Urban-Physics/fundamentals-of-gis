# Exercise 7: Air pollution analysis

By Jonathon Taylor

*Updated by Rowan van der Kaaden* 

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

Air pollution analysis using spatial interpolation techniques is a crucial aspect of understanding the distribution and impact of pollutants on human health and the environment. Air pollution has become a pressing global concern due to its detrimental effects on both society and ecosystems. The analysis of air pollution provides valuable insights into the spatial patterns, sources, and concentrations of pollutants, enabling informed decision-making for mitigation strategies and policy development.

Air pollution analysis aims to assess the levels of pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone in the atmosphere. These pollutants are associated with adverse health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reduced lung function, and increased mortality rates. Additionally, air pollution can have significant social implications, particularly for vulnerable populations residing in highly polluted areas. Environmental justice issues arise when certain communities, often marginalized or low-income, are disproportionately exposed to higher levels of air pollution, exacerbating existing health disparities.

Understanding the social implications of air pollution is crucial for promoting environmental justice and equitable decision-making. Marginalized communities often face a higher burden of pollution due to factors such as proximity to industrial areas, highways, or other pollution sources. Air pollution exacerbates existing socio-economic disparities by compromising the quality of life, limiting economic opportunities, and perpetuating health inequalities. By conducting air pollution analysis and incorporating spatial interpolation techniques, decision-makers and researchers can identify and address these social implications, striving for equitable policies and interventions to protect vulnerable populations.

Spatial interpolation techniques, facilitated by GIS, play a vital role in air pollution analysis. Interpolation enables the estimation of pollutant concentrations at locations where direct measurements are unavailable or sparse. By utilizing mathematical models and available data points, spatial interpolation creates continuous surfaces or maps of pollutant concentrations, providing a comprehensive view of air pollution patterns across the study area. This spatially interpolated information helps identify pollution hotspots, characterize exposure gradients, and assess the spatial distribution of health risks associated with air pollution.

Air pollution analysis using spatial interpolation techniques is essential for understanding the spatial distribution and impact of pollutants on human health and society. By leveraging GIS and interpolation methods, researchers and policymakers can identify pollution hotspots, assess health risks, and promote environmental justice. These analyses contribute to evidence-based decision-making, enabling the development of targeted interventions and policies to mitigate air pollution's adverse effects on both individuals and communities.

## OBJECTIVES

In this tutorial, we will learn about spatial interpolation using QGIS. We will work with point data from air pollution monitoring stations in Helsinki to estimate air pollution levels in locations where there are no stations available. We will be asking ourselves the following research questions:

- What are the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution in the Helsinki region?
- Do any areas exceed the EU recommended limit?
- What is the concentration in the wealthiest postcode? And the least wealthy?

## DATA USED/NEEDED

## Completion

Work in pairs or individually. Complete the exercise and submit a short report containing at least the following:

1. Maps of the outcome of the exercise

	- Remember: all maps should have a legend, a scale bar and a north arrow

	- Use the tips from the Crash Course to improve your map

2. A short reflection (200-300 words) on this exercise and your map

## EXERCISE PHASES

### Part 1 - Loading data

1. Download 7_Exercise_data.zip from the [Github repository](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/tree/master/Data), save it in a folder for this exercise, and extract the contents from the zip.  We have data on the location of air pollution monitoring sites in the Helsinki region.

2. Load the file *Air_pollution_monitoring_points.shp* into your QGIS project.

3. Examine the attribute table of the layer you added, what do you see?
	-  We can see that each point has some data associated with it, including the nitrogen dioxide concentration (NO2), the year of the measurement (Vuosi), the type of measurement station (Tyyppi), the location, and more.

4. Consider if it would be helpful to have some context during this analysis, maybe add aerial imagery or some other basemap for now? 

5. Let’s also add some postcode boundaries. Add the layer *Postcodes_air_pollution.shp* to the QGIS project.

6. Let’s change the symbology of the postcode boundaries to make it so that you can see the basemap beneath them.
	- Change the symbology in such a way that you can see your basemap under it (e.g. remove the fill or change the transparency)  

7. Let’s also change the symbology of the monitoring stations
	- Let’s make these a graduated symbol. Choose NO2 as the *Value*.  You will now see a map with the monitoring stations colored according to the monitored NO~2~ levels. Does anywhere exceed the EU Air Quality Directive limit of an annual average of 40 micrograms per cubic metre?

### Part 2 - Spatial Interpolation

8. Now that we have our air monitoring station data loaded, we can see their locations and have an idea of what the annual average NO2 levels recorded at these stations are. But what about where there are no monitoring stations? Can we estimate what the concentrations are in other areas, based on the closest stations? GIS has the ability to interpolate between these data points to estimate concentrations elsewhere.

9. Let’s interpolate NO2 concentration between the monitoring stations. 
	-   Open the *IDW Interpolation tool*, in the *IDW Interpolation tool*, set:
		- *Vector Layer*: Air_pollution_monitoring_points, this tells QGIS that you want to interpolate from this vector dataset.
		- *Interpolation Attribute*: NO2, the value associated with the monitoring stations that we want to interpolate.
		- Click the + symbol to add it to the list of items to interpolate
		- *Extent*: click the down arrow to the right of the extent box and choose *Calculate from Layer* > Air_pollution_monitoring_points. This will limit the interpolation to the areas covered by the monitoring stations – where we have data. Otherwise, the tool may try to interpolate over a wider area, and could lead to errors when it tries to calcuate concentrations where we do not have data.
		- *Output Raster Size* will define the spatial resolution of the interpolation – meaning the size of the grid (or pixels). Too small a grid size, and you create a very large file and the results could be misleading (i.e. it could make people think we know the pollution in a 1m2 area, which we don’t). Too large, and we won’t get a good idea of the variation because the grid will be so large. We don’t have many monitoring stations, and it is computationally more difficult to produce a large raster, so let’s make it quite coarse. Set the X and Y pixel size as 50 for both, what kind of unit do you think this is?
	- Run the tool

10. The interpolation has produced a raster from point data. We can see how the IDW algorithm has estimated the concentration of air pollution between the different points as a continuous grid, where each pixel has a value. In reality, the spatial concentration of air pollution is more varying, with differences due to the presence of pollution emission sources, urban canyons, wind, and other factors, and will vary over time as well. But, this gives us an initial estimate of how concentrations change across Helsinki.

### Part 3 - Social factors and exposures

11. Let’s now examine the concentrations in different postcodes in Helsinki. To do this, we can calculate raster statistics like we did in in a previous tutorial. 
	- Open the *Zonal Statistics* tool
	- Under *Input Layer*, select Postcodes_air_pollution. This tells QGIS that you want to calculate statistics within these postcode boundaries (the ‘zones’)
	- Under *Raster Layer*, select your Interpolated air pollution data. This tells QGIS that you want to calculate statistics from this layer.
	- Press *OK*. This will create a new vector layer that at first glance looks the same as the postcode layer. However, it now has the summary statistics for the raster joined to each postcode.

12. Open the *Attribute Table* of the new layer. You will see a column on the right that shows the average concentration. There is also a column called tr_mtu, which is the median income of households. By clicking on the column heading, you can sort the data ascending or descending. 
	- What is the postcode with the highest NO2 concentrations? 
	- What is the postcode with the lowest? 
	- What are the concentrations in the postcode with the highest median income? 
	- What is the pollution in the postcodes with the lowest median income (ignoring those with 0)? 

13. We can also join the air pollution monitoring stations point data to the postcodes. This can help us identify the number of monitoring stations in postcodes, and estimate the average concentrations based on only the monitoring stations. To do so, we will perform a spatial join.
	- Open the *Join Attributes by Location (Summary)* tool
	- Under *Input*, choose the layer you produced when you calculated the Zonal Statistics 
	- Under *Join Layer*, choose Air_pollution_monitoring_points
	- Select which *Geometric predicate* you think is best (Hint: Theory 4)
	- Under *Fields to summarize*, press the box on the right and choose NO2
	- Under *Summaries to calculate*, press the box on the right and choose *Count* and *Mean*

14. This will have created a new layer, with the default name Joined Layer. Open the attribute table. What post-code had the most NO2 monitors? How many were there?

### Map visualization  

15. You’ve now answered your research questions. Make a nice informative map, showing the interpolated air pollution raster, and the air pollution monitoring points. Insert a legend for concentrations, so we know how the air pollution is varying across the city.
