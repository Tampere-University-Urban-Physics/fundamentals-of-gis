### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 5: 

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE


## OBJECTIVES
The aim of this practical is to learn the basics of Raster GIS and to perform cartographic modeling that is based on map algebra. The subject is introduced through an exercise where the goal is to locate the optimal cultivation areas.

The student will also learn how to utilize a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and make data type conversions from vector to raster. To strengthen the assimilation, a short reflection will be written on what was done and why.

## DATA USED

## Completion

Work in pairs or individually. Complete the exercise and submit a short report containing at least the following:

1. Maps of the outcome of the exercise

	- Remember: all maps should have a legend, a scale bar and a north arrow

	- Use the tips from the Crash Course to improve your map

2. A short reflection (200-300 words) on this exercise and your map

## EXERCISE PHASES
