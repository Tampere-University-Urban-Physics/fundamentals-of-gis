### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 5: 

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
This tutorial uses data from a historical event in London, which many people consider to be the original use of map-ping to understand disease transmission. In the 1800’s, London was a rapidly growing city, with huge amounts of migration from rural England to the city. However, the city lacked modern infrastructure, and disease and over-crowding was rife.

In 1854, there was a large cholera outbreak in London, with 120 deaths within three days in the Soho area of the city. Public health officials in the city were convinced that many diseases – including cholera – were spread by ‘mi-asma’, or toxic air and poor hygiene. However, a doctor and scientist in London, John Snow, was convinced that it was spread through contaminated water, but needed to find evidence to support his theory and convince city offi-cials to close contaminated water pumps. To do this, he surveyed households in the area, plotted the locations of households with deaths, and used this to quantitative data to develop a theory about the contaminated water source.

Henry Whitehead – the local priest – knew the area and residents in Soho well, and initially did not agree with John Snow’s theory about the contaminated water pump because he knew of residents who drank from the well and did not get sick. He began his own study, interviewing residents using a qualitative social science approach, and eventu-ally came to agree with the theory about the contaminated pump. Crucially, it was Whitehead’s interviews that al-lowed the source of the contamination to be identified.

## OBJECTIVES

In this tutorial, we will learn about importing survey data and using QGIS to create a heatmap using this data, thus re-creating one of the most famous epidemiological studies using modern GIS tools. The research question we want to ask ourselves is:
- What water pump was the source of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London?
