# Theory 3: Socio-spatial differentiation & social segregation

## Background information
Socio-spatial differentiation refers to the **unequal distribution of social groups and resources across space. It recognizes that cities and other geographic areas are not homogeneous entities, but rather consist of diverse neighborhoods, districts, or zones that are characterized by distinct social, economic, and cultural features. These areas can be differentiated based on factors such as income levels, educational attainment, employment opportunities, housing conditions, access to amenities and services, and racial or ethnic composition.

This spatial segregation can lead to disparities in quality of life, opportunities, and social interactions between different social groups. Socio-spatial differentiation often reflects patterns of social inequality and segregation within a society. Certain groups may concentrate in specific areas due to historical, economic, or cultural factors, while others may be excluded or marginalized from accessing certain spaces or resources.

Understanding socio-spatial differentiation is important for analyzing and addressing social inequalities and urban development challenges. It helps identify areas that may be experiencing higher levels of deprivation or exclusion, and informs policies and interventions aimed at promoting more inclusive and equitable spatial patterns within cities and regions.
