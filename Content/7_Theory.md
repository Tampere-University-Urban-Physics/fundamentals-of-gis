# Theory 7: Spatial Interpolation

Spatial interpolation is a technique used in GIS to estimate values at unsampled locations based on known measurements from surrounding locations. It is a method of creating continuous surfaces or maps of a particular phenomenon across a study area where data points are limited or unevenly distributed.

For example of air pollution analysis, spatial interpolation allows for the estimation of pollutant concentrations at locations where direct measurements are not available or sparse. It helps fill in data gaps and provides a more comprehensive representation of pollutant levels across the study area. By utilizing mathematical models and statistical techniques, spatial interpolation generates a continuous surface that represents the varying concentration of pollutants, providing a smoother representation of the spatial patterns.

There are several spatial interpolation methods commonly used, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some of the widely employed techniques include:

1.  Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW): This method calculates the value at an unsampled location by assigning weights to nearby sample points based on their distances. Closer points have higher weights, and their values contribute more to the estimation.
    
2.  Kriging: Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation method that considers the spatial autocorrelation of the data. It estimates values based on the statistical properties of the observed data, taking into account the spatial relationships and variability.
    
3.  Radial Basis Functions (RBF): RBF interpolation uses a mathematical function that defines the influence of nearby sample points on the estimation at unsampled locations. It is particularly useful for irregularly spaced data points.
    

The choice of interpolation method depends on the characteristics of the dataset, the spatial patterns of the phenomenon being analyzed, and the desired level of accuracy. It is important to assess the reliability and accuracy of the chosen interpolation technique by considering factors such as the data distribution, spatial dependence, and the underlying assumptions of the method.

In summary, spatial interpolation is a technique that helps estimate values at unsampled locations based on known measurements in GIS. In the context of air pollution analysis, it aids in creating continuous surfaces of pollutant concentrations, filling data gaps, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of pollutants across a study area.
