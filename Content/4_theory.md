# Theory 4: Buffer and overlay analysis

## Buffer analysis
GIS buffer analysis is a spatial analysis technique used to create proximity zones or buffers around spatial features. A buffer is a defined area around a geographic object, such as a point, line, or polygon, that represents a specific distance or range. The buffer can be created by measuring a fixed distance from the object or by using other criteria, such as travel time or risk factors.

Buffer analysis is commonly used in GIS to answer questions about spatial relationships and proximity. By creating buffers around specific features, analysts can determine which other features fall within or intersect those buffers. This can be helpful in various applications, including urban planning, environmental impact assessment, transportation analysis, and emergency response planning.

The process of buffer analysis involves the following steps:

1.  Define the input feature: Identify the geographic object for which you want to create a buffer. This could be a point, line, or polygon representing a specific feature like a building, road, or water body.
    
2.  Specify buffer distance: Determine the distance or range that defines the buffer zone around the feature. It can be a fixed distance (e.g., 100 meters) or vary based on specific criteria.
    
3.  Create buffers: Apply the buffer distance to the input feature to generate the buffer zones. This involves calculating the geometric shape (e.g., circle, polygon) that represents the buffer for each feature.
    
4.  Analyze buffer intersections: Assess the spatial relationships between the buffer zones and other features in the GIS dataset. This can involve identifying features that intersect, touch, or fall completely within the buffer zones.
    
5.  Derive insights: Interpret the results of the buffer analysis to gain insights about the proximity and relationships between different geographic features. This information can be used for decision-making, planning, and resource allocation.
    
Buffer analysis can be performed using GIS software, which provides tools and functions for creating buffers and analyzing the spatial relationships. The specific capabilities and options for buffer analysis may vary depending on the GIS software being used.

## Overlay analysis
GIS overlay analysis, also known as spatial overlay analysis, is a technique used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to combine multiple spatial datasets to derive new information and gain insights about their spatial relationships. Overlay analysis involves overlaying multiple layers or maps to create a composite map that integrates the attributes and geometry of the input datasets.

The overlay analysis process involves the following steps:

1.  Select input datasets: Identify the layers or maps that you want to overlay. Each layer represents a different geographic feature or theme, such as land use, population density, transportation networks, or environmental factors.
    
2.  Define overlay operation: Determine the specific type of overlay operation to be performed. There are several common types of overlay operations, including:
    
    -   Intersection: This operation identifies the spatial extent where the input datasets overlap or intersect. The resulting output will include only the areas that are common to all input datasets.
        
    -   Union: The union operation combines all the input datasets to create a single output layer that includes the combined geometry and attributes of all features from the input layers.
        
    -   Difference: This operation identifies the areas that are unique to each input dataset, excluding the overlapping portions.
        
    -   Symmetrical Difference: This operation identifies the areas that are unique to each input dataset, including the overlapping portions.
        
    -   Overlay with attribute transfer: This operation combines the geometry and attributes of the input datasets based on specific rules or conditions. For example, it can transfer attribute information from one layer to another based on spatial relationships.
        
3.  Perform the overlay: Apply the selected overlay operation to the input datasets. This involves comparing the spatial positions and attributes of the features in each layer and creating the output layer based on the overlay rules.
    
4.  Analyze the results: Interpret the output layer to gain insights and extract useful information. The overlay analysis can reveal patterns, relationships, and spatial dependencies between different geographic features.
    
Overlay analysis is a powerful tool in GIS because it allows the combination and integration of multiple datasets to generate new information and support decision-making processes. It is commonly used in various applications, such as land-use planning, environmental analysis, market research, demographic analysis, and infrastructure development. GIS software provides tools and functions to perform overlay analysis, and the specific capabilities may vary depending on the software used.
