### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Theory 9: Public Participation GIS and Directional Distribution

## Public Participation GIS (PPGIS)/SoftGIS
Public Participation GIS, often referred to as PPGIS, is a participatory approach that combines GIS with public involvement in decision-making processes. It aims to engage citizens and stakeholders in mapping and analyzing spatial information to better understand and address local issues.

PPGIS facilitates the collection, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data by involving community members in data collection, interpretation, and decision-making. It recognizes that local knowledge and lived experiences are valuable sources of information that can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of an area and its challenges.

SoftGIS is a specific implementation of PPGIS that focuses on user-friendly software tools for data collection and analysis. It provides accessible platforms and interfaces that allow individuals with varying levels of technical expertise to participate in mapping activities. SoftGIS tools often include web-based or mobile applications that enable community members to contribute geospatial data, such as points of interest, spatial boundaries, or qualitative information, through surveys, interviews, or other data collection methods.

The collected data can be used for various purposes, such as urban planning, environmental management, social impact assessments, or community development initiatives. By involving the public in the GIS process, PPGIS/SoftGIS fosters collaboration, empowers local communities, and enhances the quality and relevance of decision-making processes.

### PPGIS/SoftGIS tools
There are several PPGIS/SoftGIS tools that have been developed to facilitate public participation in spatial data collection and analysis, but only few are freely available. A good example of a this is **Epicollect5**, an open mobile data-gathering platform developed by the University of Oxford. It was originally developed to track diseases, but is now freely available to anyone that wants to conduct surveys with location data. Especially worth checking out if you want to conduct some kind of survey with geographical data. You can find it here
