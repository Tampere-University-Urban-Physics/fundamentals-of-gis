## Introduction to QGIS

### The contents of this exercise in a nutshell:

**The aim of this practical is to** get familiar with the QGIS software. The first practical exercises will introduce the QGIS graphical user interface (GUI) and its basic tools and features to create a foundation for the later practicals. After some basic introduction, you will create a **choropleth map** with the aim of showing the number of transit boardings in areas across Helsinki. A choropleth map is a type of map that uses colours to summarise the statistics within different spatial units. We recommend the excellent [Colorbrewer tool](https://colorbrewer2.org/) to help you choose palettes which match your data and the information you want to communicate.




**By the end of today’s crash course, you will:**

-   **Be familiar with QGIS’s user interface and basic functions**
-   **Have an idea of what kind of data types GIS can process**

**Note:** If you have not yet downloaded QGIS, do so now from this link: <https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html


## The basics of QGIS

### Getting started with QGIS

**Launch QGIS** and the QGIS graphical user interface (GUI) opens (Figure 1).

![QGIS layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_layout.png)
 1. Toolbars
 2. Layers list / Browser panel
 3. Map canvas
 4. Processing toolbox panel (You might need to activate this)
 5. Locator bar
 6. Status bar

Start by setting the **default language** in QGIS to English (if it isn’t already) by navigating to the language settings: *Settings menu* \> *Options* \> *General* \> *User Interface Translation*. Tick the “*Override system locale*” box and choose English from the dropdown menu and close the window by pressing OK. For the change to take effect, restart the application.

The state of a working session in QGIS is called a **project**. Similarly, to a e.g., a workspace in ArcGIS, a project is considered the ensemble of layers, projections, table relations and other properties, such as symbols and styles, of a specific session. Remember to save your projects often to prevent work from being lost in case of a crash. Also note that project files do not contain the geospatial data, they merely contain information on where the program will find it. If you move the data or change it's name, then you have to tell QGIS where to find it again. Therefore, it is a good idea to have a folder for this course, and save the geospatial data you will use in subfolders for each exercise. 

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_save_meme.jpg)

*Here a few basic functions that are worth knowing before starting to play around with data and layers:*

![Save icon](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileSave.png) **Saving in QGIS**: You can save your project by clicking either the *save* ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileSave.png) or the *save as* icon. You can also use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl + S* (or *Command + S*) or go to *Project* \> *Save*. The file format of a project file is \*.qgs. **Hint** - GIS visualises datasets that are typically saved elsewhere. When you save a project file, you save the link to the layers you use, their symbology, the scale, and other map elements. Layers that you edit or create in QGIS are not saved when you save the project file - these need to be saved seperately. Because QGIS saves the link to the data you use, if you move or rename this data, QGIS will no longer be able to find it, and you will need to tell QGIS where to find it again. **Hint**: Save each project and its accompanying data in their own folder to keep things organized! A common source of error is not extracting a zip folder, or saving in some temporary location.  

![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileNew.png) ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileOpen.png) **Creating and opening a project in QGIS:** If you want to start a new project, you can click on the *New* icon ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileNew.png) with a blank page, or alternatively go to *Project* \> *New* or use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl + N* (or Command + N). To open an already existing project, click on the folder-like *Open* icon ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionFileOpen.png) to pick up where you left off.

**Changing the coordinate system of a project in QGIS:** You can see the current coordinate system of the project in the status bar in the lower right corner. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_project_CRS.PNG) You can change the coordinate system by clicking on the sign and selecting a new coordinate system from the list in the project properties window that pops open. You can access the same window also by going to *Project* \> *Properties* \> *CRS*. The default coordinate system in QGIS is set automatically to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84). You can change the default if you wish by going to *Settings* \> *Options* \> *CRS*. The data used in this course will mostly be in EPSG 3067 (ETRS-TM35FIN), which is the standard for nationwide data in Finland. 

(QGIS supports ‘**on the fly**’ (**OTF**) coordinate system transformation for both vector and raster layers. This means that the program will automatically draw the layers to match the coordinate system defined for the map canvas, if a transformation formula is available.)

### 1.1 Toolbars

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_toolbars.png)

Here is a brief introduction to the **basic toolbars** in QGIS. The toolbars can be toggled in *View* \> *Toolbars* by ticking the boxes. If you can’t find a toolbar mentioned below – the toolbar might not be toggled on!

The **Map Navigation toolbar** lets you zoom and pan the map view.

![Map navigation toolbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_map_navigation_toolbar.PNG)

The **Attributes toolbar** includes some of the most common tools that enable for example **selecting** and **deselecting** features, **measuring lines** and getting access to the **attribute table** and **field calculator**.

![Attributes toolbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_attributes_toolbar.PNG)

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_data_source_manager.png) **Adding data in QGIS:** The **Data Source Manager** offers a handy way to add a vector or raster layer. There are also special buttons for different kinds of database layers and interface services. The figure below offers a closer look at the Data Source Manager. Similar functionality can be found in *Layer* \> *Add Layer*.

![Data Source Manager](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/datasource_manager.png)
If you want to create new empty layers, go to *Layer* \> *Create Layer*. You would use this, for example, if you're creating your own data. 

### 1.2 Panels

**Panels** offer a single major function. Similarly, to toolbars, they can be toggled from *View* \> *Panels*. Below is an example of three panels (Browser, Layer Style and Statistics) on top of each other.

The ***Browser panel*** is a tool for browsing, searching, inspecting, copying and loading QGIS resources. Using the Browser panel you can locate, inspect and add data. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_browser_panel.png)

The ***Layer panel*** lists all the layers in the project and helps you manage their visibility and shape the map. You can access the layers by right clicking them, and toggle their visibility by toggling the check box in the layer panel. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_layer_panel.png)

The ***Processing Toolbox*** shows the list of all available **algorithms** grouped in different blocks, this is where you will find most of the tools we will be using in this course. If you ever want to do something and you're wondering if it is available in QGIS, this is a good place to start!  

![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/_images/toolbox3.png)

### 1.3 Plugins

Only a fraction of all the possible tools and functions are visible in the default view of QGIS as a lot of functionality is done via **plugins**. You can manage plugins in the QGIS plugin manager: select *Plugins* \> *Manage* and install plugins. Here you can see what plugins are already installed to your repository and install new or update/uninstall current plugins. In some rare cases, you may not be able to find a tool for an exercise because it was not included in your installation. Plugins is a good place to look for it.

![Plugins](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/plugin_details.png)

Let’s download a very handy plugin called **QuickMapServices**, which gives access to a wide selection of background maps.

1.  Select *Plugins* \> *Manage*
2.  Select *All* on the left menu and type “QuickMapServices” in the search bar
3.  Select the QuickMapServices plugin and *Install the plugin*
4.  You can find the newly installed plugin in the main QGIS window under *Web* \> *QuickMapServices*

(Hungry for more? Further reading on plugins in the QGIS manual: <https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/index.html>)



## 2 Warm-up exercise

### 2.1 Add and explore data

1. In order to get a proper touch of QGIS and how the different tools work, we will of course need data. Download 1_Exercise_data.zip from the [Github repository](https://github.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/tree/master/Data), save it in a folder for this exercise, and extract the contents from the zip. 

2. Open the Data Source Manager (see 1.2)
	- Select *Vector* from the menu
	- Press the “…” button next to the *Vector Dataset(s)* field
	- Navigate to the folder where you saved the data for this practical and select the following files from the folder (Click + Ctrl to select multiple items):
    		- Helsinki_small_areas.shp
    		- Helsinki_Municipality.shp
    		- HSL_helsinki_stops.shp
    		- Waterbodies.shp
	- Press *Open*
	- Press *Add*

These data sets are all downloaded from Paituli and Helsinki Region Infoshare data and map services, the data itself is produced by numerous entities (National Land Survey, Helsinki Regional Transport and the City of Helsinki). You can also add the Helsinki_roads.shp layer later for visualization purposes.

The shapefiles should now appear on the map canvas. Once you add the layers, the program should automatically change the project’s coordinate system to EPSG:3067, or more commonly known as the ETRS89-TM35FIN (Transverse-Mercator) coordinate reference system, which is a system for projecting spatial data in Finland.

For a start, take your time to move around and get acquainted with the basic tools in QGIS. Try panning around and zooming in and out in the map view. If your layers “get lost” by mistake when zooming, simply right click on the layer in the layers panel you want to retrieve and select *Zoom to layer*.

**Whilst moving around, try out the following two tools:**

![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionIdentify.png) The **Identify Features** tool is essentially an info-tool that identifies the object(s) selected with it and lists the attribute data available for all the layers in that particular location. If you only want to look at information from a specific layer, use the drop-down menu to specify the layer you want to examine.

![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionMeasure.png) The **measure** tool can be used to make simple distance and area calculations on the map, as well as for measuring angles. The tool can calculate both the length of single line segments and the sum of all drawn lines. The measurement unit can be changed from the tool options.

3. Managing the **layers** is key in GIS. Right now, the added layers are arbitrarily symbolized and ordered, and do not come out very useful or informative. Thus, we need to get our hands dirty.
	- Start by **changing the order of the layers** by dragging them in the layers panel on the left side of the map view. What do you think could be a good order? For example, the order can be as follows from top to bottom: HSL_Helsinki_stops, Waterbodies, Helsinki_small_areas and Helsinki_Municipality.
 	- You can also **change the visibility of the layers** by checking or unchecking the tick boxes next to the layer name or by adjusting **transparency**. The latter can be done under the *Style* tab in the *Layer properties* window, which can be accessed by right-clicking on the layer name and selecting *Properties*. This is also where you can change other style properties such as **symbol size and color**, **layer rendering** or create e.g. **choropleth maps** (we will look into these in more detail later on).
 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_layers.png)
 In addition to editing a layer’s style properties, the Layer properties window can also be used for e.g. examining the **layer’s general information** such as its coordinate system and source, adding **labels** to the map as well as managing **joins** and layer **metadata**.

4. Next, we want to **change the styles and the symbology of the layers**. You can navigate back to the *Symbology* tab in the *Layer Properties* window. The window looks slightly different depending on whether we have a raster or vector file, and what feature type is in question. You can see this for instance by comparing the style tabs of the HSL Stops (point feature) and Waterbodies (polygon feature) layers.
	- Open the *symbology* properties for the Waterbodies layer
	- Apart from the color fill and a few ready-made styles, the main view does not offer very sophisticated visualizing options, so it is suggested to click on the *Simple fill*
	- Press the *Fill color* button and change the color of the layer to blue
	- If you want a transparent fill, change the *Opacity* under the *Fill color* section
	- Once you are satisfied with the layer styles, press *Apply* and *OK*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_symbology1.png)

 5. It is also possible to **visualize the layers based on the information stored in the attribute table**. This can be done by selecting Categorized or Graduated instead of Single Symbol from the dropdown menu on the top of the page.	
	
	- Open the HSL_Helsinki_stops layer symbology
	- Choose *Graduated* from the dropdown menu
	- Choose "Boardings" as the value from which the data is gathered
	- Click *Classify* to add data classification
	- Set the *Mode* to *Natural breaks (Jenks)* and press *Classify* again to update the classes
	- Select a fitting *Color ramp* from the drop-down menu
	- Press *Apply* and *OK*


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_symbology2.png)


**Now, using the previous tips and tricks as your support, change the styles of all the layers in the project.** Keep in mind what was discussed in the theory before - e.g. could a colourblind person read this map?

6. Next, we shall move the focus from visualization to the **actual data**. Start by examining what data is included in the project and what information is stored in the layers by right clicking on the layer name and selecting *Open Attribute Table*.
	- Open the *attribute table* of the layer called Helsinki_small_areas. Take a moment to examine the table, what can you see?
		- The attribute table is similar to data in excel, in a sense that it's data in a table on which you can perform calculations on. The main difference is that in GIS each row corresponds to a spatial feature. 
		- As you can see, the file consists of a list of the small-sized areas within the city of Helsinki with their corresponding codes and creation dates but little else. Next, we are going to calculate the area for each small area of Helsinki. 
	- In the *attribute table*, toggle *Editing mode* ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionToggleEditing.png) and then click on the *Field Calculator* button ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionCalculateField.png)
 
 7. Now we’ll **write an expression that calculates the area of each small area of Helsinki in square kilometers**. On the right side of the Expression window is a list of drop-down menus.
	- Open the *Geometry* drop-down menu
	- Double-click the *\$area* expression (you can also type *\$area* in the blank *Expression window*)
	- Just the *\$area* expression would calculate the area in square meters, but we want square kilometers. So we will divide it by 1 000 000. Click or type the division symbol (/), and type 1000000 after the division
	- Set an informative *Output field name* (For example: Area_km2)
	- Set the *Output field type* to *Decimal number (real)*, and *Output field length* to 10 and 2 (try the other options and look how this changes the preview value) 
	- Click *OK*
	- Finally, click the *Save Edits* button ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionSaveEdits.png) and disable *Editing* mode ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionToggleEditing.png) to make the changes permanent

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/1_CrashCourse_exercise_expression.png)

 8. **Using the field we just created in the attribute table, explore the small areas of Helsinki**. By clicking on attribute table columns, you can sort the data. Which is the tiniest? How about the largest? By clicking on the attribute table on a certain row, for instance Viikki, you select that area and highlight in the map view. You can also select features with expression. Click open *Select features by expression*. Alternatively you can find tools from the *Processing Toolbox*.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_select_by_expression1.png)
	- Open the *Field and Values* drop-down menu, which will show all the attribute fields
	- Double-click on the area field you made earlier (Area_km2)
	- Type "< 5" to the right of the field in the text field
	- Click *Select features*
	- Your selection now includes all the areas under 5 square kilometers in this layer, with selected objects shown in **yellow in on the map** and **blue on the attribute table**.
	- Examples of ofther expressions include:
 		- "Area_km2" = 5, select the features the area of which is exactly 5 square km
   		- "Area_km2" > 2 AND "Area_km2" < 5, select the features the area of which is between 2 and 5 square kilometers  
	- Close the *Select by expression* window and deselect all the features by clicking *Deselect all* ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionDeselectAll.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_select_by_expression.png)

9. Next, we’re going to create and calculate another field into the Helsinki_small_areas attribute table using the HSL_Helsinki_stops point data. First open the *attribute table* of HSL_Helsinki_stops to familiarize yourself with its contents. The "Boardings" column depicts the number of boardings on stops in Helsinki on average per day. Say we want to learn where the areas are with the most boardings in Helsinki? We have the point locations of boardings and the outlines of the small areas, so we can combine them and find out **We will calculate and visualize the public transit passenger numbers per area for every Helsinki small area using something called a spatial join.** 
	
	- Check if the *Processing Toolbox* is active in the top right of the main QGIS window, if not open it by selecting *Processing* > *Toolbox* from the top of the window
	- Type “Join attributes by location” into the search bar. Select the one that has (Summary) after it.
		- Read the information about this function, what do you think it does? 
		- This tool could look different to you depending on the version of your QGIS install. 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_join_attributes_by_location.png)
	- The parameter window for the algorithm opens and here you have to specify what the algorithm does and with what data
	- Set the follow values:
		- *Base layer*: Helsinki_small_areas
		- *Join layer*: HSL_Helsinki_stops
		- *Geometric predicate*: contains (What do you think the other options mean?)
		-  *Field to summarise*: Boardings
		- *Summaries to calculate*: *Sum*
		- *Discard records which could not be joined*: Yes
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_join_attributes_by_location1.png)
	- Click *Run*
	- A new temporary layer, Joined Layer, was created in the *Layers Panel* and by opening its *attribute table* you should see it’s similar to the Helsinki_small_areas *attribute table*, but with a new field, "Boardings_sum", which is the sum of all the passengers from every bus and train stop within that particular small area of Helsinki.
	- Right-click the Joined Layer and select *Make permanent* to save the temporary scratch layer for further processing
		- Temporary layers will be lost when closing QGIS and are best not used for further processing
		- Make sure to save the data in your project folder when doing this! Double check the location, as QGIS sometimes does weird things and saves it somewhere else. 
![](https://github.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/blob/master/Assets/5_Exercise/5_Exercise_icons_diagram.drawio.png?raw=true)
	- Save the joined layer as ESRI Shapefile, with a sensible name (for example "Helsinki_small_areas_HSL.shp"), and within the folder for your project you made earlier
	- Delete the temporary Joined Layer from the Layers window

 10.   **Now we’ll calculate yet another field** using the *field calculator* by dividing the number of passengers by the square kilometer area of the Helsinki small areas.
	- Calculate this field using the *Field calculator* (don’t forget to toggle editing mode): output field name should be informative e.g. “PassArea”
	- Set *Output field type* to decimal, Set output *field length* to 10 and *precision* to 2
	- Then you must enter the calculation into the Expression field, you can either use the drop-down menus (Fields and values) or simply type it in. The calculation should be similar to this (change if your fields are named differently): "Boardings_sum" / "Area_km2"
	- Click OK. Remember to *Save edits* and *Disable editing mode*.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_attribute_table.png)

11.  Head to the layer’s *symbology* tab and select **Graduated** from the drop-down menu. **Select the PassArea column as the data source and press Classify**. Try out different classification Modes. What are their differences and which do you think is best for this purpose? Choose which you think is best and visualize the data as desired (you can check ColorBrewer for ideas). You can edit the class bounds and the legend values manually by double clicking on them. Which areas are the most passenger heavy and which are not? Why?

12. Now it is time for the finishing touches. To make the map easier to interpret, we are going to **add labels** to it.
	- Right-click the layer we just visualized and go to *Layer properties* > *Labels*
	- Select *Single labels* form the drop-down menu to enable labeling
	- Choose the column from the list that contains the area names (name_fi)
	- You can edit the label placement and appearance, for example add a halo around it by selecting buffer in the lower section

### 2.2 Creating a map output in QGIS
The last phase of this practical will concentrate on creating a map output. In this case, we want a choropleth map of small areas, symbolised according to the number of boardings. **Hint** Think about what layers are important to communicate the result, and what layers you no longer need. A good map only contains the information required.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/1_CrashCouse_exercise_layout.png)

1. In QGIS, the map layout is done in a separate window called a **Print layout**. While the main window is for geospatial analysis, you can consider the layout window as more of a graphical editor. Press on the *New Print layout* button ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionNewLayout.png) in the *File toolbar* or go to *Project* > *New print layout*. Give a name for the composer in the opening window, and an empty map window should appear on the screen.

2. The next step is to add the content to the screen. Press the *Add map* button ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionNewMap.png) in the left side panel and drag from the corners to match the paper orientation. Now, you should see the same view as in the working view. If you want, you can change the paper orientation in the right-side *Composition panel* under the section *Paper and quality*.

	You can orientate in two ways in the composer: 
- To move the window, select *Move item* ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_move_item.png) or press the keyboard shortcut **V** and drag as desired 
- To move the content on the map, select *Move item content* ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tampere-University-Urban-Physics/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/1_CrashCourse_Exercise/QGIS_move_item_content.png) or press the keyboard shortcut C and drag as desired 

	***Hint**: If you are not satisfied with your layers for the final map, you can always go back to the main panel and adjust them while you are in the layout manager.*
	NB! Remember, that **if you make changes in your working view, you need to press ***Refresh view*** ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionRefresh.png) in order to see the changes in the print composer view!

3. A proper map should always have at least these three elements: a **north arrow**, a **scale bar** and a **legend**. All of these can be found in QGIS under the Layout-tab or the left hand-side toolbar in the Print layout. Add the mentioned elements to your map and visualize them as desired.
		
	- ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionLabel.png) **Adding a label**: You can change the default text as well as the font and colors of the label from the Item properties window in the lower right corner.
	- ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionScaleBar.png) **Adding a scale bar**: Click where you want to add it and customize it as desired. The size and the colors can be modified from the right-side Item properties panel.
	- ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/mActionAddLegend.png) **Adding a legend**: You probably have to modify the legend a bit so that it looks informative on the map. The modification can be done from the Item properties. 
		-  *TIP: To remove unnecessary information from the legend of your map, make sure that the Auto Update box is unchecked in the Legend Items section of Item Properties in the print layout composer. Then remove (using the buttons with + and – symbols) and rename (by double-clicking on the title) items as you wish.*

 	- ![](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/_images/north_arrow.png) **Adding a North arrow or an image**: To do this, press Add North Arrow and click on the layout. If you want to modify the look of the arrow, go to Item properties and open the Search directories tab (see the picture on the right). Click on the desired arrow.

4. Once you are satisfied with your map, **save the project** and go to *Layout* > *Export as image* to **save your layout as an image file**. If you want to adjust the export resolution (default is 300 dpi, higher value = higher resolution image and larger file size), you can do that prior to exporting from the Layout panel. **Save your map under your course folder and submit the finished map on Moodle.**
