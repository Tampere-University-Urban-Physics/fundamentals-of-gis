# Exercise 8:

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

In this exercise your task is to **calculate building efficiency ratio on different spatial scales**. Efficiency ratios (e) describe the level of land use intensity on zoned city areas. The building efficiency ratio is calculated by **dividing the total floor area** of each story of a building (or buildings) **by the size of the piece of land the building is in**. The piece of land can be the real estate, a neighborhood, a city district or any specified area. This ratio can be used to identify areas which are urban (more efficient) from non-built (less efficient) areas. Conversely, “sparsity ratio” is the total area of all non-built features to the size of the piece of land. When calculating the building efficiency on a city district (or similar) scale, it depicts regional efficiency. When building efficiency is calculated on a property/plot scale it’s known as plot efficiency (see Table 1). During this exercise, you will discover the different forms and levels of urbanity in Helsinki.

**E = total floor area/total land area**
