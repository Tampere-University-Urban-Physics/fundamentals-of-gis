### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 8:

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

Today’s theme is socio-spatial differentiation & social segregation and we’re going to be looking at the
Helsinki metropolitan area’s population dynamics. Thus far we’ve learned about building efficiency ratios
as indicators of urban intensity and next week we will talk about clustering of businesses, but cities are
more than that. One of the key components of the city is missing and as Shakespeare so eloquently put in
Coriolanus “What is the city, but the people?”

Socio-economic features of the inhabitants of the city vary across geographical space and across time.
Today we are using the Statistics Finland’s Grid Database 2016 about the social structure in 250x250m
grid cells. Our task today is to study socio-spatial differentiation and pinpoint low-education and lowincome
grid cells. This could also be an interesting starting point for the analysis if we study segregation
in the region.

To do this, the data needs some clean-up, some fields need to be calculated and the lowest quartiles for
different variables (income, education) have to be found. You will be using the conditional statement
functionality from the previous practicals. The results are once again to be visualized on a map and to be
analyzed in the report.
