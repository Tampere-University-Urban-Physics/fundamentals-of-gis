### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 9: PPGIS/SoftGIS

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

Participatory sensing for GIS has become a useful tool to extract quantitative and qualitative information
about the environment. Using map questionnaires is an easy way to collect experiential or other types of
information from the inhabitants about the everyday environment. Tools like Maptionnaire have enabled
urban planners, researchers and activist groups to gain insight about areas and phenomena. These tools
have been used to find places/areas that feel safe, insecure, noisy, quiet and so on. Directing the map
questionnaires towards a certain population group (children, the elderly, immigrants etc.) can yield
valuable data for planning and research purposes. Commonly, this way of obtaining spatial data through
the public is known as Public Participation GIS (PPGIS), SoftGIS and Social/Participatory Sensing.With
the increasingpresence of socialmedia servicesand location services of smart technology,miningof social
media data has become a frontier of “socially sensed” data.

Today we’re using an online map questionnaire from2015 about possible wind power sites to study the
NIMBY(Not inmybackyard) phenomenoninHelsinki(if you’re interestedin the phenomenon, seeVeikko
Eranti’s (2017) article “Re-visiting NIMBY: From conflicting interests to conflicting valuations” in Moodle
or here: http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:uta-201804051508). Unlike previous times, this time you’ll have to
download the data as it is froman open data portal (www.hri.fi). You’ll get familiarwith some of the
common difficultiesof working with open data and especially open GIS data. You’ll also learn to use a
new and helpful tool in QGIS.
